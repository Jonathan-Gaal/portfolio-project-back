VALUES ('Moroccan Hanging Lantern', 'nickel plated trays, cotton strands from dog-toys (for tassels), paracord, wooden frame from discarded japanese lantern, yarn, plastic crystals from discarded candelabrum, assorted lamp parts, premade tassels, brass bell', 'I made this piece from 8 nickel plated trays I got for $1 per at dollar tree. I used an awl to punch out the patterns and screwed the trays to a wooden frame I liberated from a box shaped japanese shoji lantern style lamp that I found discarded in the trash one fine day. The large tassels hanging on each of the 4 corners are made from untwisted dog toys, again from dollar tree, and hang on a string made from red patterned paracord. Another great feature is that the power cord is completely covered in yarn masking the fact that this is an electric lamp. I love the touch that there is a long pull-chain that has a small brass bell on the end that rings whenever you pull on or off.

I even sold the lamp with another shade on Craigslist for what I paid! The bottom round section is made from a random brass piece I found on the street in Manhattan. It is fixed to the lampshade upper section via brass plated chains from costume jewelery. There is an ornamental cross piece on the bottom that I made from 2 random brass pieces screed onto the bottom section. Adorned with colored tassels and costume jewelery bracelets. One of my brighter lamps. Really lights up my life.', 'lighting', '10-12-2022', 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dkedfonvh/image/upload/w_1000,ar_1:1,c_fill,g_auto,e_art:hokusai/v1676647137/frontend-portfolio-project-images/artworks/C80446F7-8670-4E29-924B-6E393DA36127_1_105_c_lgzg6x.jpg', 'N/A', '10"', '30"', '15"' );
