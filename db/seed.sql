I was practicing a few tricks on my mini scooter one fine night and headed home satisfied. On the way, I spied a dumpster outside a warehouse and inside was a treasure trove of carpet samples -- any of them handmade from wool, either hand-knotted or hand woven! I did my best to dig through the lot with the flashlight of my phone and sorted through the samples as best I could choosing ones that fit my style -- for there were all styles, ranging from traditional oriental carpet, to modern samples. I gathered about 50 or so oriental samples and loaded them in a massive pile on top of the narrow deck of my mini Razor scooter. I tied them on -- if you can call it that lolz! with a piece of strong twine I cur off the dumpster with my key. To secure it more I believe I made makeshift ropes with plastic wrap. Off I went! Lemme tell you, hell, hell, hellish hell on earth! The tower of piled samples was so heavy and kept coming undone. I had to periodically had to completely undo and redo the pile when pushing it became impossible. It took me hours to get home -- only about a mile, pushing the scooter bent down. It was the wee hours, maby 4am by the time I got back, and I had class the next day! Not recommended, haha! As far as the process of making it, its rather simple: match some samples wiith a matching or contrasting pattern and sew them together with yarn. Add some tassels made from unraveled dog-toy strands and voila! ', 'Pillow', make_timestamp(2022, 8, 12, 0, 0, 0), make_timestamp(2023, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0),'N/A', '25 in.', '18 in.', 'N/A' ),

I started by buying a jumbo lampshade from a thrift store for $3 and removed the cheap plastic material that comprised the actual "fabric" of the shade and replaced it with a very thin transluscent patterned Indian shawl I found clinging for life on a shrub branch in Ditmas Park Brooklyn. After I seweed this into place, I adorned the edges with varying sewing trims: multicolor pom-pom, white tassel, and golden thread sewing trims. The top and bottom edge are wrapped with colored yarns. The space between the spokes is adorned with a criss-cross network of colorful friendship bracelets. The bottom boasts a metal Turkish/Moroccan style copper colored dome thar I liberated from a solar powered light-- a misguided purchase, but a fine addition to this project.

I found a large amount of leather one fine night whilst exploring the the Astoria/Long Island City area of NYC by moon and city light. The stitchwork is not the neatest, but its not meant to be. It is menat to look rustic and ancient. One of my more interesting projects thenatically. It will come as no surprise that I wanted to make a bag with world-famous Moroccan leather work as the primary inspiration. The form and tassels specifically are in keeping with that theme. But the designs would seem to tie it to Africa rather than Morocoo. And theres also an ancient Grecian helmet in profile on it as well as a trident. So what''s uo with the African and Greek elements on a Moroccan bag? Well Morocco is an interesting country with an interesting mix of cultural influences over thousands of years. Amazigh (Berber) tribes, Greeks, Romans, Africans, Jews and others. In fact, the Amazighs, better known as the Berbers were so dubbed by the Greeks, who refered to anyone who did not speak Greek as a "Barbarian", since their language sounded like "bar bar bar" to them. With this cultural/historical backdrop in mind, the thematic elements make perfect sense. I simply decided to highlight some of the more ancient and obscure threads of that cultural tapestry and wear the past and present on my shoulder and spread that arcane message when I wear my messenger bag!', 'Clothing & Accessories',make_timestamp(2022, 6, 12, 0, 0, 0), make_timestamp(2023, 2, 17, 0, 0, 0), 'N/A', '14 in.', '18.5 in.', 'N/A' ),
